### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up 

> Install modules via `VENV`  

$ virtualenv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Set Up Database
First of all create a postgresql db named OneTrack and update persistence in core/setting.py changing the password to your own password, then run the following commands:
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

> Start the app

$ python manage.py runserver 
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. 

> Note: To use the app, access the registration page and create a new user. After authentication, the app will unlock the private pages.

> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users
